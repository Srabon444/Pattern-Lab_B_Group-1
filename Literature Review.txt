Literature: A Deep Learning Method to More Accurately
      Recall Known Lysine Acetylation Sites

Dataset Used: CPLM (29,923 Human Lysine Acetylated Sites)

Responsible Residue: Lysine Acetylation

Reduced Redundant Data:  F-Score

Imbalance Data Handle: Randomly Selected(16,107 negative fragments)

Algorithm: Six layer MLP (Neural Network Framework)

Feature Extraction: one-hot, BLOSUM62 matrix,CKSAAP, Information Gain (IG), physiochemical properties, 
			Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM)

Performance Measure: K-Fold Cross Validation,Independent Test Set

Comparison Tool: NetAcet, PAIL, PSKAcePred, LAceP, etc

Measuring Metrices: Acc, Sn, Sp, MCC, AUC, ROC

Conclusion: This Papersâ€™ deep learning classifier is much more effective in processing big data 
		than other classifier.
